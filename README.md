# üöÄ Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## üì¶ Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.  
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

- The page will reload automatically when you make changes.
- You may also see any lint errors in the console.

---

### üß™ `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.  
Learn more about testing [here](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests).

---

### üèóÔ∏è `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.

- React is bundled in production mode for optimal performance.
- The build is minified and filenames include hashes.
- Your app is ready for deployment!

Learn more about deployment [here](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment).

### ‚öôÔ∏è `npm run eject`

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note: This is a one-way operation! Once you `eject`, you can't go back.**

Ejecting gives you full control over the build configuration. It:

- Copies configuration files (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) into your project.
- Removes the single build dependency.

Most projects **do not need to eject**. Use this only if you need advanced customization.
